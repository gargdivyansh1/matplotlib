Types of grphs which could be made using matplotlib: line graph
                                                     pie chart
                                                     histogram 
                                                     bar chart
                                                     scatter plot 
                                                     custom graph

                                        
Terms you must know: 
1: Data Point = single pair of value for the data representation
2: x-line and y-line -- and you must label them always
3: Figure = Entire canvas called as figure which is the collection of many graphs
4: Axes = Graph Box (actual area where the graph is plotted )
5: Plot = actual line bar shape which is drawn in the graph 
6: Marker = a symbol is used for marking the data Point
7: Line = the connection made between data points by the help of line
8: line Style = the way how the line is drawn in the graph 
9: color = color of every thing 
10: legend = the small box which tell that which thing is denoting what in the graph 
11: label = for labelling the x-axis and y-axis 
12: title = for heading of the graph 
13: grid = the lines made in the background 
14: function = the functions are used for performing the certain task and used paranthesis for calling them
15: method = ............
16: parameters = these are the information which are provided for the functions and methods 
17: keyword agruments = like this is used for customisation or providing info with the detail like color = green 
18: object-oriented API = ...........
19: DPI = dots per inch (higher DPI = clear image)
20: backend = used for drawaing the plots
